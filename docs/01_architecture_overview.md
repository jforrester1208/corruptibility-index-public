**Corruptibility Index (CI) – Public Overview**  
**Non-technical Summary for External Audiences**

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This file provides a high-level, public-facing explanation of how the Corruptibility Index (CI) is structured.  
It intentionally avoids:

- proprietary scoring formulas  
- metric weights  
- internal models  
- data-processing logic  
- any intellectual property or implementation details  

It is suitable for public distribution (website, GitHub, press kits, academic outreach).

---

## 2. What the Corruptibility Index Measures

The Corruptibility Index evaluates *patterns of behavior* and *structural risk indicators* that are widely recognized in:

- political science  
- public administration  
- investigative reporting  
- anti-corruption research  

CI does **not** determine guilt or illegality.

Instead, it highlights **risk signals** that appear consistently in environments where corruption or undue influence is more likely.

---

## 3. Multi-Metric Structure

CI uses a **multi-metric approach**, meaning no single indicator dominates the score.  
The system combines several categories of publicly documented factors, such as:

- patterns in financial activity  
- relationships and influence networks  
- decision-making anomalies  
- transparency or disclosure gaps  
- governance and oversight pressures  

Each category reflects well-documented research on how corruption risk tends to manifest.

---

## 4. Data Sources (Publicly Accessible)

CI relies exclusively on **publicly available information**, including:

- public financial disclosures  
- campaign donation records  
- property and asset records  
- legislative records  
- official lobbying disclosures  
- news reporting  
- watchdog and transparency organizations  
- publicly posted government documents  

No private, leaked, or confidential data is used.

## 5. How CI Processes Information (High-Level Only)

Although the internal implementation is proprietary, the public can understand CI at a conceptual level:

### Step 1 — Collect Public Records  
CI gathers structured, publicly available information relevant to corruption risk.

### Step 2 — Organize Information  
Data is organized into consistent categories to ensure fair comparison across individuals or entities.

### Step 3 — Compare Patterns to Established Research  
CI evaluates the presence or absence of risk indicators based on what academic, regulatory, and investigative literature identifies as correlating with corruption.

### Step 4 — Generate an Overall Risk Signal  
The system produces a single **Corruptibility Index score**, representing a relative level of risk compared with typical patterns found in similar roles or environments.

## 6. What CI Is *Not*

CI is **not**:

- an accusation  
- a legal finding  
- a claim of wrongdoing  
- a prediction of future behavior  
- a partisan scoring tool  

It is a structured way to analyze publicly observable patterns.

---

## 7. Transparency Philosophy

The public-facing CI architecture follows three principles:

1. **Explainability**  
   Users should understand the broad reasons for a score.

2. **Fairness & Nonpartisanship**  
   Indicators are based on research, not ideology.

3. **Public Verifiability**  
   All underlying inputs come from sources that anyone can check independently.

---

## 8. Who CI Is For

The public-facing CI platform is intended for:

- citizens seeking transparency  
- journalists  
- academics  
- civic technologists  
- nonprofit researchers  
- policy analysts  

It is not intended for:

- personal attacks  
- campaign advertising  
- legal claims  
- speculative accusations  

Any misuse violates CI guidelines.

---

## 9. Future Enhancements (Public Plans Only)

The following non-proprietary improvements are planned:

- expanded public explanations of each risk indicator  
- downloadable open-data bibliography  
- interactive graphs showing category-level contributions  
- educational pages explaining corruption risk research  
- API access to public CI scores  

No internal logic or private models will be exposed.

---

## 10. Disclaimer

This document intentionally omits:

- formulas  
- scoring weights  
- internal mechanisms  
- proprietary methods  
- restricted architectural components
