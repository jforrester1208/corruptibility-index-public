# Corruptibility Index (CI) — Public FAQ

## 1. What is the Corruptibility Index (CI)?
The CI is a *public-interest transparency tool* that analyzes patterns in publicly available information to highlight **corruption-risk indicators**.  
It does **not** determine guilt or wrongdoing.  
It simply surfaces structural risk signals observed in decades of anti-corruption, political science, and investigative research.

---

## 2. What does a CI score represent?
A CI score reflects the **degree to which publicly visible patterns** around an individual resemble known corruption-risk indicators.

It is:
- a **risk signal**, not an accusation  
- based solely on **public data**  
- nonpartisan  
- pattern-oriented  
- research-informed  

It is **not** a measure of honesty, morality, legality, or intent.

---

## 3. What kind of information does CI use?
Only **publicly available** information, such as:
- financial disclosures  
- donations databases  
- lobbying and meeting records  
- real estate filings  
- legislative actions  
- investigative reporting  
- ethics/enforcement records  

No private, leaked, or confidential data is ever used.

---

## 4. Does CI use artificial intelligence to generate scores?
**No.**  
AI is used only for **clerical extraction tasks**, such as organizing public documents.  
All scoring is controlled by a **deterministic, rule-based system**, not an AI model.

AI cannot assign scores, determine weights, interpret intent, or influence the final result.

---

## 5. Does a high score mean someone is corrupt?
**No.**  
A higher CI score means the public data patterns resemble known corruption-risk factors.  
It does **not** imply guilt, misconduct, or intent.

CI evaluates *structural transparency risk*, not wrongdoing.

---

## 6. Is the CI partisan or ideological?
No.  
The CI treats:
- all individuals  
- all parties  
- all ideologies  
- all geographies  

according to the **same underlying framework**.  
It is grounded in research, not politics.

---

## 7. What are CI’s metric categories?
The CI uses 11 broad categories of risk signals, including:
- donor patterns  
- wealth and asset changes  
- real estate structures  
- lobbying activity  
- appointments and benefits  
- policy pattern shifts  
- network influences  
- personal conduct concerns  
- legal/regulatory history  
- high-risk industry associations  
- investigative/journalistic attention  

Each reflects well-documented patterns in corruption-risk research.

---

## 8. Why doesn’t CI publish its formulas?
To prevent:
- manipulation or “gaming”  
- reverse engineering  
- partisan exploitation  
- distortion of the scoring system  

This is the same approach used by:
- credit scoring systems  
- compliance ratings  
- cybersecurity indices  
- fraud detection models  

CI publishes its **principles**, not its **math**.

---

## 9. Can individuals appeal, challenge, or correct public information?
Yes.  
Because CI uses only public data, anyone may:
- point out inaccuracies in public records  
- submit corrections  
- request updates when information changes  

CI updates data when public sources are revised or corrected.

---

## 10. What happens when new public information appears?
CI updates scores in alignment with its governance framework.  
Updates are:
- systematic  
- evidence-based  
- versioned  
- traceable  

The CI does not make ad-hoc changes or respond to political events.

---

## 11. Does CI make predictions about future behavior?
No.  
CI identifies **risk patterns**, not future actions.  
It does not forecast misconduct or interpret intent.

---

## 12. Who is CI for?
The CI may be useful to:
- journalists  
- researchers  
- academics  
- civic technologists  
- compliance/ethics groups  
- the general public  

Its purpose is **public transparency**, not political advocacy.

---

## 13. Does CI assign corruption labels?
No.  
CI avoids stigmatizing terms and does not label individuals “corrupt.”  
It presents **risk scores** and **contextual explanations**, nothing more.

---

## 14. Does CI include personal or private-life data?
No.  
CI only uses **public transparency-related records**.  
Private, personal, medical, or family details are excluded entirely.

---

## 15. What safeguards prevent misuse of CI?
Safeguards include:
- private formulas to prevent gaming  
- restricted AI usage  
- structured governance  
- nonpartisan design  
- strict data provenance rules  
- clear responsible-use policies  

These safeguards prevent misinterpretation and exploitation.

---

## 16. Can CI be used in elections or campaigns?
The CI is **not** a political weapon.  
Responsible-use guidelines prohibit treating CI as:
- an accusation  
- a moral judgment  
- a legal claim  
- campaign material  

CI is a transparency tool, not an advocacy tool.

---

## 17. How is CI different from Transparency International’s CPI?
Key differences:

| **CPI (Corruption Perceptions Index)** | **CI (Corruptibility Index)** |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Measures corruption in entire countries | Measures transparency-risk indicators of individuals |
| Based on expert perception surveys       | Based on structured public records |
| Country-level                            | Person-level |
| Opinion-centered                         | Pattern-centered |
| Not designed for individual assessment   | Designed specifically for individuals |

The CI is fundamentally a different tool with a different purpose.

---

## 18. Is CI peer-reviewed?
The CI is grounded in peer-reviewed research, but the model itself is **not yet** formally peer-reviewed.  
A structured academic collaboration phase is planned.

---

## 19. How often is CI updated?
Conceptual updates occur when:
- new research becomes available  
- public data availability changes  
- methodological clarity improves  

Each public-facing score is tied to the version under which it was generated.

---

## 20. How can I learn more?
You can learn more through:
- the CI project website  
- the public GitHub repository  
- published transparency documents  
- research references included in the Evidence Overview
