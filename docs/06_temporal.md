**Corruptibility Index (CI) – Public Explanation of Temporal Considerations**  
**High-Level, Non-Technical Summary**

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document explains, in a public-safe manner, **how the Corruptibility Index (CI) considers time** when evaluating risk patterns.

It describes:

- why timing matters  
- how events are contextualized  
- how CI avoids outdated or stale information  
- how CI preserves fairness across long careers  

No internal parameters, decay functions, or proprietary logic are disclosed.

## 2. Why Time Matters in Corruption-Risk Assessment

Research across political science, compliance, and behavioral economics consistently shows:

- **recent events** tend to carry more relevance  
- **older events** may lose significance as circumstances change  
- **patterns over time** often matter more than isolated incidents  

Temporal reasoning helps CI:

- avoid overweighting distant-history events  
- identify emerging patterns  
- distinguish between ongoing behavior and isolated anomalies  
- reflect changes in transparency, oversight, or personal conduct  

---

## 3. What CI Does With Older or Outdated Information (Conceptual)

Temporal handling ensures:

- long-past events diminish in influence  
- very recent events do not cause disproportionate volatility  
- stable patterns over years receive appropriate recognition  

Rather than treating all points in time equally, CI recognizes that **risk evolves**.

---

## 4. How CI Uses Temporal Information (Public Overview)

Although the internal mechanics are proprietary, the public can understand the general approach:

### **1. Recency Matters**
More recent events typically carry more interpretive weight than those that happened many years ago.

### **2. Historical Context Is Preserved**
Older events are not erased; they simply influence the score differently than recent ones.

### **3. Patterns Over Time Are More Important Than One-Off Events**
Regular occurrences spaced over several years may indicate structural risk, while isolated incidents may not.

### **4. Career Trajectories Are Considered**
CI is designed to be fair across:

- long-serving officials  
- new entrants  
- individuals who change roles or industries

## 5. Why CI Does *Not* Publish Its Temporal Logic

Disclosing the exact temporal rules would:

- enable gaming of the system  
- create incentives for timing manipulation  
- allow reverse engineering of proprietary logic  
- compromise fairness  
- undermine CI’s defensibility  

Like credit scoring, cybersecurity risk systems, and compliance mechanisms, CI keeps its temporal model internal.

The public receives a **principled description**, not the internal mechanics.

---

## 6. Typical Temporal Patterns Considered (Conceptual Only)

Below are **non-technical examples** of how timing may matter in risk research (not CI formulas):

- events that happened yesterday are not interpreted the same as those from a decade ago  
- a sudden change in patterns may signal emerging risk  
- extended quiet periods may reduce interpretive weight  
- repeated behaviors over long spans may indicate structural issues  

These examples illustrate principles, not CI implementation.

## 7. Ensuring Fairness Over Time

Temporal considerations help CI maintain:

- **accuracy** (avoiding outdated risk signals)  
- **fairness** (recognizing individuals evolve)  
- **consistency** (scoring comparable roles similarly)  
- **stability** (avoiding erratic changes due to single events)  

This makes CI more reliable and interpretable for public use.

---

## 8. What CI Does *Not* Do

CI does **not**:

- erase public history  
- assume guilt based on timing  
- assign expiration dates to news or public records  
- perform legal or moral judgment of past actions  

Temporal considerations are strictly a **risk-modeling concept**, not a value judgment.

---

## 9. Disclaimer

This is a public transparency document.  
It intentionally omits:

- decay constants  
- mathematical functions  
- proprietary internal rules  
- timing thresholds  
- recency-weighting values  
- implementation details  

Those components are part of the private CI-Core weighting architecture.
