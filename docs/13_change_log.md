**Corruptibility Index (CI) – Public Model Update Summary**  
**High-Level, Non-Technical Transparency Document**

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document provides the public with a **general overview** of how the Corruptibility Index (CI) communicates major updates to the model.

It does **not** disclose:

- internal version numbers  
- scoring changes  
- technical modifications  
- formulas or weights  
- confidential governance decisions  

Instead, it describes the **philosophy and communication approach** behind CI updates.

---

## 2. Why CI Publishes Public Change Summaries

Because CI is used by journalists, researchers, civic technologists, and engaged citizens, it is important to:

- inform the public when meaningful updates occur  
- maintain transparency about the evolution of the system  
- reinforce CI’s commitment to fairness and accountability  
- help users understand when specific scores were generated under different models  

This ensures that CI remains a **trustworthy and reproducible** public-interest tool.

## 3. What Public Change Summaries Contain

Public-facing update notes generally document:

### **1. Conceptual Improvements**
High-level descriptions of enhancements to transparency, documentation, interpretability, or user experience.

### **2. Expanded Public Resources**
Examples:
- additional metric explanations  
- improved public guides  
- better educational materials  

### **3. Methodological Clarifications**
General explanations of refinements in the understanding of corruption-risk indicators — without revealing internal scoring logic.

### **4. Version Identification**
Public materials clearly indicate when the CI model changes so users can reference which version produced which score.

### **5. Ethical and Responsible-Use Updates**
Any changes to CI’s public safety, fairness, or governance policies.

These updates preserve openness without revealing sensitive internal mechanics.

---

## 4. What Public Change Summaries **Do Not** Include

To prevent gaming, misinterpretation, or exploitation, public change notes do **not** disclose:

- formulas  
- metric weights  
- transformation rules  
- confidence or temporal adjustments  
- outlier treatment  
- AI extraction thresholds  
- scoring algorithms  
- internal versioning logic  
- regression test results  
- proprietary architectural details  

These remain in the private CI-Core repository.

## 5. Examples of Public-Safe Update Types

Below are examples of the *kinds* of updates that might be published, *without revealing model logic*:

### **A. Enhancements to Public Explanations**
- clearer descriptions of metric categories  
- better visualization in the public dashboard  
- updated FAQ entries  

### **B. Expanded Data Transparency**
- new descriptions of publicly used data sources  
- additional research references  
- improved educational content  

### **C. Major Version Announcements (Conceptual Only)**
- noting that a new model version is active  
- summarizing improvements in plain language  

### **D. Ethical and Governance Policies**
- updates to responsible-use guidelines  
- clarifications on what CI scores represent  

### **E. Infrastructure / Accessibility Improvements**
- website enhancements  
- API availability announcements  
- performance improvements  

None of these contain operational detail.

## 6. Public Communication of Major Updates

When major conceptual updates occur, the public may see:

- a short announcement on the CI website  
- an updated public README  
- a version label (e.g., “CI Model v2 Public Release”)  
- a plain-language summary of what changed and why  

Again, these summaries avoid internal mathematics and scoring logic.

---

## 7. Historical Transparency Without Technical Exposure

CI maintains a public commitment to:

- tracking when conceptual updates occur  
- documenting how the model evolves at a high level  
- making it easy to see when significant public-facing changes were introduced  

But CI **never** publishes internal scoring details, ensuring the integrity of the model.

---

## 8. Disclaimer

This public change log intentionally omits all proprietary:

- internal change histories  
- numerical modifications  
- formula/weight revisions  
- regression analysis  
- governance signatures  
- model-calibration details  

Those elements are available only in the private CI-Core repository.
